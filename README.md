# An ARCHIVE of OLD community FX files (and links to effect libraries) with limited compatibility.  
### [Click HERE to view a link overview page to current FX libraries for installation in current versions of Lightworks.](https://github.com/FxSchrauber/lwks-fx)  

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Old effect libraries for installation in OLD [Lightworks] ([NLE]) versions: 
- [Compatible with Lightworks 2023 (GitHub, outdated forked backup from February-26-2024)]()
- [Compatible with Lightworks version 2022 and some previous versions (Forum link).](https://forum.lwks.com/threads/custom-and-user-effects.246700/)  
  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Additional OLD effects (all FX-files stored directly in this repository):
The following additional OLD effects files were never released by the community because, apart from being old, some of them have additional compatibility limitations, others are prototypes whose functionality should be improved or tested.
Maybe some of the effects meet your needs. If not, feel free to further develop the code.

- [**Remove colour banding or compression artefacts**](Colour_banding/README.md)
- [**Orbit** (texture circle around the Effect center).](DVE/DVE_Extras/Orbit/README.md)
- [**Diffusion** (Transition as a pixel fog)](Mix/Prototypes/Diffusion/README.md)
- [**From circle to rectangle** (Distortion)](Stylize/Distortion/CircleToRectangle/README.md)
- [**Random asymmetric flicker** (Switches)](User/Switches/RandomFlicker/README.md)
- [**Windows only** (effects with limited ompatibility)](Windows_only/README.md)
